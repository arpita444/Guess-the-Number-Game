umber Guessing Game
This is a simple console-based number guessing game where you try to guess a randomly generated number within a certain range. You can choose between two difficulty levels: "easy" and "hard," which determine the number of attempts you get.

How to Play
Clone the repository (or download the main.py and logo_art.py files).

Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

Run the game from your terminal:

Bash

python main.py
(or python your_game_filename.py if you named it differently)

The game will prompt you to choose a difficulty level ("easy" or "hard").

Enter your guesses when prompted.

The game will tell you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct.

Try to guess the number before you run out of attempts!

Clear Feedback: Tells you if your guess is too high or too low.
