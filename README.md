# Number Guessing Game

---

This is a simple console-based number guessing game where you try to guess a randomly generated number within a certain range. You can choose between two difficulty levels: "easy" and "hard," which determine the number of attempts you get.

## How to Play

1.  **Clone the repository** (or download the `main.py` and `logo_art.py` files).
2.  **Make sure you have Python installed** on your system.
3.  **Run the game** from your terminal:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

    (or `python your_game_filename.py` if you named it differently)

4.  The game will prompt you to **choose a difficulty level** ("easy" or "hard").
5.  **Enter your guesses** when prompted.
6.  The game will tell you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
7.  Try to guess the number before you run out of attempts!
